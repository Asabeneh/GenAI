## Using AI Tools

### Q: How do I write a good prompt?

**A:** Follow the "Context + Request + Constraints" formula:

**Example:**
```
Context: "I'm a teacher creating a lesson plan for 5th graders"
Request: "Write a 10-minute activity about the water cycle"
Constraints: "Make it hands-on and require only common household items"
```

See our [prompt engineering guide](./prompt.md) for more tips!

---

### Q: Why did AI give me a bad response?

**A:** Common reasons:
1. **Prompt too vague:** "Tell me about marketing" → "Write a 200-word guide to social media marketing for small businesses"
2. **Lack of context:** "Write an email" → "Write a professional email to a client apologizing for a delayed shipment"
3. **Unrealistic expectations:** AI isn't perfect—it needs good inputs to give good outputs

**Solution:** Refine your prompt and try again! AI gets better with iteration.

---

### Q: Can I continue a previous conversation?

**A:** Depends on the tool:
- **ChatGPT:** Yes, keeps conversation history (you can also start new chats)
- **Claude:** Yes, maintains conversation context
- **Gemini:** Yes, with conversation history

### Q: What are "tokens" and why do they matter?

**A:**
- **Token:** A chunk of text (roughly 3/4 of a word)
- **Example:** "Artificial Intelligence" ≈ 3-4 tokens

**Why they matter:**
- AI has token limits (how much it can process at once)
- Free tiers may limit tokens per month
- Affects conversation length and document size

**Rough guide:**
- 100 tokens ≈ 75 words
- 1,000 tokens ≈ 750 words
- ChatGPT-3.5: 4,096 token limit per conversation
- ChatGPT-4: 8,192 or 32,768 token limit (depending on model)

---

### Q: What's "context window"?

**A:** The amount of text AI can "remember" or consider at once.

**Example:**
- Small context: Can only consider the last few messages
- Large context: Can consider an entire conversation or long document

**Practical impact:**
- Larger context = better understanding of long conversations
- Larger context = can work with longer documents
- GPT-4 has a larger context window than GPT-3.5

---

### Q: Can I run AI on my own computer?

**A:** 
- **Chat AI (like ChatGPT):** Generally no, too resource-intensive
- **Smaller AI models:** Yes, possible with technical setup
- **Local image AI:** Yes, tools like Stable Diffusion can run locally

**For most users:** Cloud-based tools (ChatGPT, Claude) are easier and more powerful.

## Troubleshooting

### Q: AI says it can't do something I know it can do. Why?

**A:** This happens because:
1. **Overly cautious:** AI errs on the side of caution
2. **Misunderstood request:** Rephrase your prompt
3. **Policy restrictions:** Some topics have restrictions

**Solution:** Try rephrasing:
```
Instead of: "Write my essay"
Try: "Help me outline an essay about [topic] with main points and supporting arguments"
```

---

### Q: AI's response was cut off mid-sentence. What happened?

**A:** Probably hit the response length limit.

**Solutions:**
- Ask AI to "continue" or "keep going"
- Ask for the complete section: "Finish the last paragraph"
- Request shorter responses upfront: "Keep under 300 words"

---

### Q: AI keeps giving me the same type of response. How do I get variety?

**A:** Try:
1. **Ask for alternatives:** "Give me 3 different versions"
2. **Specify style:** "Make it more casual" or "Make it more formal"
3. **Add constraints:** "Use a metaphor" or "Include a personal story"
4. **Start a new conversation:** Fresh start can help

---

### Q: I get an error message. What should I do?

**A:** Common fixes:

**"Too many requests" error:**
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- Free tiers have rate limits

- Try incognito/private window
- Reset password if needed

---

### Q: AI response is in the wrong language. How do I fix it?

**A:** 
```
Simply say: "Please respond in English" (or your preferred language)
```

Or be explicit in your prompt:
```
"Explain [topic] in simple Spanish for beginners"
```

---

### Q: How do I save/export my conversation?

**A:**
- **ChatGPT:** Click on your chat, then click share icon → Copy link, or export data in settings
- **Claude:** Copy and paste conversation into a document
- **Gemini:** Share or export options in menu

**Best practice:** Copy important responses to a document—don't rely solely on AI platforms to save them.
