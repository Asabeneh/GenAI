# Prompt and Prompt Engineering

## 1. What makes a **good prompt**?

**Example:**

* Bad prompt: *"Tell me about space."*
* Good prompt: *"Explain the difference between a planet and a star in simple terms for a 10-year-old."*

**Sample Answer:**
A good prompt is **clear, specific, and goal-oriented**. It helps the AI understand the context and the level of detail required.

---

## 2. How does **specificity** in a prompt affect the quality of an AI’s response?

**Example:**

* Prompt A: *"Write about dogs."*
* Prompt B: *"Write a 100-word paragraph about the history of dog domestication and its impact on humans."*

**Sample Answer:**
The more specific the prompt, the more focused and useful the response will be. Vague prompts often produce general answers.

---

## 3. In what situations would you prefer a **short, open-ended prompt** versus a **detailed, structured prompt**?

**Example:**

* Open-ended: *"Tell me a story."*
* Structured: *"Write a 3-paragraph story about a lost cat that finds its way home."*

**Sample Answer:**
Open-ended prompts are useful for **creative exploration**, while detailed prompts are better for **precise tasks** where structure and outcome matter.

---

## 4. How can adding **role-playing instructions** improve responses?

**Example:**

* Without role: *"Explain climate change."*
* With role: *"Act as a science teacher and explain climate change to high school students using simple examples."*

**Sample Answer:**
Role-playing provides **context and tone**, making the response more tailored and relatable.

---

## 5. Why is **iteration** important in prompt engineering?

**Example:**

* First try: *"Summarize AI."* → Too broad.
* Refined: *"Summarize the main applications of AI in healthcare in 3 bullet points."*

**Sample Answer:**
Iteration helps refine prompts until they produce the desired response. The first attempt is rarely perfect.

---

## 6. What are some techniques that help improve prompt outcomes?

**Example:**

* Few-shot: *"Translate 'hello' to French: bonjour. Translate 'goodbye' to French: au revoir. Translate 'thank you' to French:"*
* Step-by-step: *"Solve this math problem step by step: 25 × 16."*

**Sample Answer:**
Techniques like **few-shot examples, step-by-step reasoning, and setting constraints** guide the model toward better answers.

---

## 7. How do **biases in prompts** influence AI responses?

**Example:**

* Biased: *"Why are electric cars better than gas cars?"*
* Neutral: *"Compare the advantages and disadvantages of electric cars and gas cars."*

**Sample Answer:**
Biased prompts lead to **one-sided answers**, while neutral prompts encourage **balanced and fair responses**.

---

## 8. How does the **audience and purpose** of your request affect prompt design?

**Example:**

* For experts: *"Provide a technical explanation of blockchain consensus algorithms."*
* For beginners: *"Explain blockchain using a simple analogy that a 12-year-old can understand."*

**Sample Answer:**
The **audience and purpose** determine the level of complexity, tone, and vocabulary used in the prompt.

---

## 9. What challenges might someone face if they don’t know how to engineer prompts effectively?

**Example:**

* Poor prompt: *"Help me with my work."* (unclear, no context)

**Sample Answer:**
They may get **irrelevant, confusing, or overly generic answers**, wasting time and effort.

---

## 10. How do you see **prompt engineering evolving** in the future?

**Example:**

* Current: *"Write me a blog post on AI in education."*
* Future: AI might automatically understand intent with little prompting and ask clarifying questions.

**Sample Answer:**
Prompt engineering will likely become **less manual** as AI improves, but understanding how to guide models will remain important.
